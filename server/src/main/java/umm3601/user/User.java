// There are two examples of suppressing CheckStyle
// warnings in this class. If you create new classes
// that mirror data in the database and that will be managed
// by Jackson, then you'll probably need to suppress
// the same warnings in your classes as well so that
// CheckStyle doesn't shout at you and cause the build
// to fail.

// Normally you'd want all fields to be private, but
// we need the fields in this class to be public since
// they will be written to by the Jackson library. We
// need to suppress the Visibility Modifier
// (https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config_design.html#VisibilityModifier)
// check in CheckStyle so that we don't get a failed
// build when Gradle runs CheckStyle.
